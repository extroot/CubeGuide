Each algorithm solves a pair (an edge and a corner) into their designated location.\n\nEach case is recognized by the position and orientation of the two pieces in relation to the target slot. Since there are four possible target slots, each case has four variants to avoid rotations.\n\nThe basic 41 cases deal with all permutations where the two pair pieces are on the U layer and/or in the target slot.
